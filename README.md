# Personal money counting application (Android)
This application is in development stage.  
Currently, you can use it as a bootstrap for your own project and
pull some ideas from the project.  
Feel free to make some improvements or change the business logic.

## What is the purpose of this application?
This application helps people to see how much money they spend
on some usual staff (it can be food, taxes, habits, etc.).  
It will help them:
- Drop some unnecessary expenses and use this money for something
much more interesting;
- calculate how much money they can postpone (maybe, for some trip
or adventure).

## Design:
I'm going to draw some basic wireframes and create a prototype for
the application.

## Features:
- [ ] Customer can create new categories (e.g., "Taxi", "Food", "Restaurant")
- [ ] Customer can see all the records for this month
- [ ] Customer can see all the records for the previous month
- [ ] Statistics (by month/quarter/semester/year), some charts.
- [ ] Notification in the end of a month with aggregated data.
- [ ] Recommendation tips


Also, I'm going to create a server for storing data to collaborate users.
In this case customer will be able join other people (maybe, family or parents)
to their account and see aggregated reports and detailed statistics for the group.
